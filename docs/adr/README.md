# Architecture Decision Records

This directory stores Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

ADRs are required when a change settles or revises a high-impact technical decision that future contributors would otherwise have to reconstruct from commit history.

## When To Write An ADR

Write an ADR when changing:

- subsystem ownership boundaries
- persistence model or schema strategy
- mission plugin contracts
- scheduling semantics
- permission and policy strategy
- camera or analyzer architecture
- build, packaging, or distribution strategy

## ADR Format

Use [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) and keep each ADR focused on one decision.

Recommended sections:

- Status
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Alternatives considered

## Workflow

1. Create the next numbered ADR.
2. Keep the title concrete.
3. Link related ADRs when a decision depends on earlier ones.
4. Update architecture docs if the decision changes system understanding.
