# Engineering Story

## The Problem We Are Solving

Most alarm apps are easy to copy at the UI level and hard to trust at the systems level. A serious alarm app is not a clock widget with extra screens. It is a reliability product that happens to have a UI.

That distinction drives the entire architecture.

## Why Flutter Is Not The Alarm Engine

Flutter is a strong choice for product velocity, interface quality, and cross-platform ergonomics. It is not the right place to anchor alarm-critical behavior on Android.

An alarm app has to survive:

- overnight Doze
- reclaimed app processes
- boot and time changes
- lock-screen launch constraints
- sensor and camera mission handoff while the ring service is already active

For those reasons, the app uses Flutter as the shell and native Android as the execution core.

## Why This Is A Dart And Kotlin Split, Not A Plugin Grab Bag

The project is not split between Dart and Kotlin because "some things were easier native."

It is split because the product has two fundamentally different responsibilities:

- product surface and interaction design
- reliability-critical Android execution

Dart owns the parts that benefit from fast UI iteration and a clean declarative shell:

- dashboard and settings flows
- alarm editing
- diagnostics presentation
- mission UI and interaction rendering

Kotlin owns the parts that must remain correct even if Flutter is not present at the moment the system wakes:

- exact alarm scheduling
- ring-session persistence
- audio and vibration ownership
- lock-screen/full-screen launch
- inactivity timers and re-trigger behavior
- dismissal authorization

That split is important because it keeps the bridge narrow and intentional. The goal is not "Flutter app plus some native helpers." The goal is a UI shell talking to a native alarm engine that has clear authority.

When that authority line is blurry, alarm apps accumulate hidden failure modes:

- UI state starts acting like source of truth
- mission progress becomes route-dependent
- background enforcement depends on a live isolate
- contributors add features by expanding the bridge instead of strengthening the model

The Dart/Kotlin split is therefore a systems boundary, not a convenience choice.

## Why The Project Is Local-First

The project exists partly as a rejection of ad-driven alarm apps. The cleanest way to keep that promise is to make the product work entirely on-device:

- no account dependency
- no backend dependency
- no telemetry dependency
- no internet dependency in MVP

This also improves reliability. An alarm should not degrade because a remote service changed or became unavailable.

## Why Alarm Persistence Lives In Device-Protected Storage

There is an important difference between:

- data that is private to the app after unlock
- data that must still be available before first unlock after reboot

An alarm app needs the second category for alarm-critical state.

Android clears scheduled alarms on reboot. If the app wants to restore them on `BOOT_COMPLETED` and `LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED`, it has to read persisted alarm definitions at that moment. Credential-protected storage is too late for that.

That is why alarm definitions and active ring-session state live in device-protected storage instead of normal app-private credential storage.

This is not a casual storage choice. It is a reliability decision:

- reboot recovery should not wait for first unlock
- exact alarm rebuilding should work in direct boot mode
- active alarm state should remain consistent with how the scheduler is restored

This does increase the importance of local security controls. Once alarm-critical persistence becomes direct-boot readable, backup policy and exported-component discipline matter even more. That is one reason the project also disables Android auto-backup in MVP and treats the security model as part of the architecture.

## Why Flutter Startup Must Stay Minimal In Direct Boot

Direct boot introduces a trap that is easy to miss in Flutter projects.

The Flutter engine can start and render UI before first unlock, but not every plugin or startup-time package is safe in that environment. A dependency that assumes credential-protected preferences, normal file access, or a fully unlocked user session can crash the Flutter side even while the native alarm engine is behaving correctly.

That is why the project treats Flutter startup as a constrained surface:

- `main.dart` should remain minimal
- no nonessential plugin initialization should happen eagerly at startup
- unlocked state must be confirmed explicitly through the native layer
- before first unlock, the app should show only alarm-critical UI or a minimal holding screen

This is a hard boundary, not a style preference.

If contributors casually add startup dependencies without thinking about direct boot, they can break exactly the scenario the native alarm engine was designed to survive.

## Why Local-First Still Needs A Tight Attack Surface

Local-first is not the same thing as low-risk.

An alarm app still exposes security-sensitive behavior:

- it can wake the screen
- it can take over the lock-screen experience
- it can schedule work to run later without user interaction
- it stores mission state and alarm definitions locally

That means the project has to care about local attack surface, not just network attack surface.

The right standard is:

- another app should not be able to trigger alarm-only UI states casually
- internal reschedule and ringing paths should not be open to arbitrary external callers
- local persistence should not quietly escape into backup flows if the product promises on-device privacy
- release distribution should use proper signing hygiene rather than debug-era defaults

For this project, security is therefore mostly about component boundaries, permission use, persistence policy, and exported-surface discipline.

## Why The Active Alarm Needs A Real State Machine

An active alarm is not just "currently ringing" or "not ringing."

As soon as missions, snooze caps, recovery, and inactivity enforcement exist, the system needs to distinguish meaningfully different states:

- `ringing`
- `mission_active`
- `snoozed`

Those states are not UI decoration. They change what the system is allowed to do:

- whether audio should be playing
- whether dismissal is legal
- whether a timeout should re-trigger the alarm
- whether the lock-screen experience should stay active
- how recovery should behave after process death

Without a persisted state machine, contributors end up encoding these rules indirectly through flags, route assumptions, or service-local conditions. That works only until the first serious recovery bug.

The state machine exists to make alarm behavior explicit and recoverable.

## Why Unsupported Missions Are Hidden Instead Of Merely Disabled

There is a difference between:

- a feature that exists but is temporarily unavailable
- a feature that cannot run on this device right now

For the second case, leaving the mission visible in the editor is the wrong signal. It tells the user "this is part of the configuration surface" even though saving that configuration would create a broken alarm.

That is why the `Steps` mission disappears from the editor when:

- the device does not expose a usable live step detector
- `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION` has not been granted

The repair path still exists, but it belongs in diagnostics and settings rather than in the alarm editor itself. The editor should describe what can be configured now. Settings should explain how to make more missions available.

## Why The Mission System Must Be Modular

Dismissal missions are the main reason contributors will want to extend the project. If missions are embedded directly into the ring service or UI routing, every new challenge becomes an architecture risk.

The project therefore needs a mission contract with strict boundaries:

- the alarm engine decides when a mission is required
- a mission driver decides how completion is evaluated
- the UI renders progress and input for the active mission

This separation should make it possible to add new missions without re-auditing the scheduler on every feature.

## Why Mission Solving Does Not Silence The Alarm Immediately

The first naive version of a mission alarm is easy to imagine:

- the alarm fires
- the mission screen appears
- the sound keeps blasting until the mission is done

That approach is simple, but it is poor product design for any mission that takes real time. If a user is genuinely engaging with the challenge, continuous full-volume ringing becomes noise rather than enforcement.

The opposite extreme is also flawed:

- the mission screen opens
- the alarm immediately goes silent

That weakens the alarm because opening a screen is not evidence of real engagement. A user can tap into the mission and then do nothing.

The confirmation step exists to solve that tension.

It creates a deliberate transition:

- first, the alarm is firing and demanding attention
- then, the user explicitly accepts mission work
- only then is the alarm allowed to become silent

That is why the confirmation screen is not just a UX flourish. It is the product-level boundary between coercion and effort.

Once the user crosses that boundary, silence is conditional rather than permanent. Native inactivity enforcement makes the quiet period earned and revocable.

## Why Mission Silence Is Enforced Natively

If a mission becomes silent, the system still needs a way to punish stalling.

That cannot depend on:

- a Flutter timer
- a particular widget being mounted
- route-local state
- a best-effort callback after process reclaim

The inactivity timeout is native because it is part of the enforcement model, not just the interface. A mission may be quiet only while the native layer still has evidence that the user is engaged.

That design is stricter, but it keeps the product honest: the silence during mission solving is a controlled state, not a loophole.

## Why Mission Activity Must Be Mission-Specific

One of the easiest ways to accidentally weaken the alarm is to define "activity" too loosely.

If any pointer event can refresh the silent-mission timer, then the timer stops measuring engagement and starts measuring screen contact. That creates obvious cheats:

- random tapping can keep a math mission quiet
- permission-repair flows can accidentally buy silence
- empty touches on a steps screen can replace actual walking

The project therefore treats activity as mission-specific evidence:

- math uses answer-field interaction and answer submission
- steps uses accepted native step-detector events
- generic touches do not count unless the mission explicitly defines them as meaningful

This matters because the timer is not decorative. It is part of dismissal enforcement.

## Why The Math Mission Is More Than A Toy Feature

Math is the first mission not because it is the most exciting one, but because it proves the platform shape with low hardware complexity.

It is the right first mission to validate:

- mission-specific configuration
- native runtime progress
- multi-step completion instead of one-shot dismissal
- UI-to-native answer submission
- recovery of in-progress mission state
- silence plus inactivity re-trigger during active solving

If the math mission cannot be made coherent, the more complex `Steps` and `QR` missions would be built on a weak base.

## Why The Steps Mission Uses `TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR`

Android exposes two step-related hardware sensors with very different behavior:

- `TYPE_STEP_COUNTER` gives a cumulative total since reboot and may batch updates
- `TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR` emits an event when the device believes a step happened

For background wellness tracking, the counter can be acceptable. For a live alarm mission, it is the wrong tool. The user is staring at the screen and expects the mission to react immediately.

The steps mission therefore uses `TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR` because:

- the UI needs prompt progress feedback
- the silence timer needs real-time walking evidence
- a cumulative reboot-total counter introduces unnecessary bookkeeping and weaker UX

This still does not produce perfect anti-cheat. Device vendors can classify some motion badly. That is why the implementation also filters impossible cadence bursts instead of pretending the hardware signal is perfect.

## Why Permission Recovery Does Not Buy Quiet Time

The settings and mission surfaces must help the user recover from revoked permissions, especially for `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`.

But a repair action is not evidence that the mission is being solved.

If a permission button refreshed the quiet timer, a user could keep the alarm silent indefinitely by poking the repair path without ever restoring the mission prerequisite or making progress.

That is why permission recovery is supported but does not itself count as mission activity.

## Why The Quiet Timer Is Visible

Once mission solving becomes silent, the user needs to understand that the silence is conditional.

Without a visible timer:

- users can be surprised by a re-trigger while they are mid-problem or mid-walk
- it is harder to tell whether the app is still recognizing real activity
- contributors are forced to reason about invisible enforcement state

The quiet timer exists for clarity, not decoration.

Just as importantly, it is derived from the persisted native timeout deadline. Flutter does not guess at a 30-second window locally. The UI reads the same authoritative deadline the alarm engine will use for re-triggering.

## Why QR Is More Than A QR Feature

The first vision mission is QR scanning, but the real engineering decision is to establish the camera boundary correctly now.

If QR is implemented as a disposable plugin tied to one screen, future object-recognition work will require rewriting the camera stack. Instead, the project should build a reusable native vision pipeline:

- CameraX handles preview and frame analysis
- a `VisionAnalyzer` consumes frames
- mission logic reacts to analyzer results

That keeps v1 practical while making future TinyML or TFLite work a matter of swapping analyzers, not redesigning ownership.

## Optimization Audit Snapshot: March 11, 2026

By the end of Sprint 7, the product behavior was strong enough that the next engineering question was no longer "does it work?" but "does it work efficiently under stress?"

That matters for an alarm app because the runtime is not idle while the user is sleeping or racing to dismiss an alarm. The system is doing real-time work at the worst possible moment:

- sensor-driven mission progress
- silent-mission inactivity enforcement
- camera analysis
- active session recovery and repainting while the screen is on

An optimization audit on March 11, 2026 identified five issues worth recording before the implementation changed.

### 1. Steps Progress Was Polling The Entire Active Session Too Frequently

The first version of the steps mission refreshed the full active alarm session from Flutter four times per second.

That was acceptable as a bootstrap because it kept the UI simple and let the native steps mission prove itself quickly. It was not a good long-term shape:

- every poll crossed the method channel
- every poll re-read persisted native session data
- every poll rebuilt more Flutter state than the step counter actually needed

This was the clearest signal that the active-session model needed a push path, not just a query path.

### 2. Quiet-Timer Refreshes Were Using Service Churn For A Small State Update

Mission activity updates were routed back through the ringing service even when the only real work was:

- extend the mission timeout deadline
- persist the updated session
- reschedule the timeout alarm

That meant "user is still solving the mission" could wake service lifecycle machinery that was really designed for audio ownership and ringing transitions.

This was the wrong boundary. Extending a deadline is engine state management, not a foreground-service concern.

### 3. The Active Alarm Screen Was Repainting Too Much For The Quiet Timer

The visible quiet timer was useful, but the initial implementation refreshed the whole active alarm screen several times per second.

That is a poor trade:

- the timer itself is tiny
- the screen around it is visually heavy
- mission widgets do not need to rebuild just because a countdown ticked

The timer needed to become a local repaint surface rather than a reason to rebuild the whole ringing UI.

### 4. Vision Session Startup Was Too Eager To Rebind Camera Resources

The QR mission runner and native vision manager were both biased toward "start again just to be safe."

That is understandable during early camera work, but it creates extra churn:

- repeated preview/session startup on resume and widget update
- repeated provider rebinds even when the active config did not actually change
- unnecessary latency during permission recovery and scanner resume

The intended architecture was already session-based. The implementation needed to become idempotent enough to match that model.

### 5. Vision Resources Needed An Explicit Lifecycle End

The first vision implementation stopped scanning, but it did not yet make strong guarantees about releasing every long-lived native resource when the activity or engine was torn down.

For a real alarm app, that is not a minor cleanup item. Camera analyzers, executors, and scanner clients are exactly the sort of resources that look harmless until enough retries, resumes, or activity recreation events accumulate.

The audit therefore treated explicit disposal as part of correctness, not just memory hygiene.

### What This Audit Means

The main lesson was that reliability and performance were converging on the same engineering rule:

- the native alarm engine should own state transitions cheaply
- Flutter should repaint only the parts that actually changed
- mission progress should move by events when the system already knows something changed
- camera resources should behave like owned session resources, not convenient globals

The optimization pass that follows this audit is therefore not about micro-benchmarks. It is about bringing the implementation into line with the architecture the project already claims to have.

### Optimization Response

The implementation pass that followed this audit made five structural changes.

First, active-session propagation became event-driven instead of relying on high-frequency Flutter polling. Native session persistence now emits active-session updates to Flutter, which means the UI can react to real state changes rather than repeatedly asking for the whole session just to move a steps counter.

Second, mission-activity timeout refreshes were pulled out of the ringing service and into a dedicated native coordinator. Extending the silent-mission deadline is now treated as a small state-and-scheduling update instead of a reason to spin up foreground-service lifecycle work.

Third, the visible quiet timer stayed in the product, but its repaint scope became local. The timer still updates smoothly, but it no longer forces the entire active-alarm surface to rebuild several times per second.

Fourth, the QR mission startup path became idempotent. Re-entering the same camera mission configuration now reuses the existing session when possible instead of rebinding preview and analysis just because Flutter resumed or rebuilt a mission widget.

Fifth, the vision pipeline gained an explicit disposal path. Camera analysis resources, scanner state, and executor ownership now end with the activity lifecycle instead of relying on process cleanup as a hidden resource-management strategy.

These changes matter because they improve three things at once:

- battery and CPU behavior while an alarm is active
- UI smoothness during live missions
- contributor clarity about where state changes are supposed to happen

That combination is the real goal of the optimization work. The project should feel faster because the architecture became tighter, not because the code accumulated isolated performance tricks.

### Performance Tooling Response

Once the runtime optimizations were in place, the next requirement was repeatability.

It is not enough to say:

- startup feels fast
- the app seems idle
- a trace looked okay one time on one phone

That is why the repository now carries its own Android performance toolchain:

- a Macrobenchmark module for repeatable cold-start measurement on a connected device
- a manual Perfetto capture script for focused trace collection outside the benchmark harness
- a dependency-audit script that proves where unexpected Android background work is entering the app graph

This matters because performance work easily drifts into folklore if the only evidence is a few `adb` commands typed from memory. The repository now has a documented path from measurement to trace artifacts to architectural interpretation.

### Why The Benchmark Variant Is Release-Like But Not Minified

The benchmark target uses a dedicated `benchmark` build type rather than pointing directly at the normal `release` APK.

That decision was not made because a benchmark build should behave differently from release. It was made because the benchmark harness and the shipped release artifact answer different questions.

The benchmark build type is configured to be:

- non-debuggable
- release-like in code generation and runtime shape
- debug-signed for local installation
- stable under repeated local benchmarking

It intentionally skips minification and resource shrinking.

Why:

- the real `release` APK is already validated separately with minification enabled
- the synthetic `benchmark` build type hit Flutter-plugin and shrinker edge cases that made the benchmarking target less stable than the shipped artifact
- benchmark repeatability is more important here than perfectly duplicating the release packaging pipeline

This is a pragmatic split:

- Macrobenchmark measures a stable release-like target
- release smoke validation measures the real minified artifact

Both are necessary, and neither replaces the other.

### Why `profileinstaller` Is Now An Explicit App Dependency

The first real benchmark run on the Android 16 test device exposed a tooling problem rather than a product problem: the app was still using an older transitive `profileinstaller` version through Flutter's dependency graph.

That was invisible until Macrobenchmark tried to drive compilation behavior on a modern Android version.

The fix was to pin `androidx.profileinstaller:profileinstaller:1.4.1` explicitly in the app module.

That choice is worth recording because it is part of the performance contract now. The benchmark harness depends on the target app having a sufficiently recent profile installer, and the repository should state that dependency intentionally rather than inheriting it by accident.

### Why `profileable` Lives Only In The Benchmark Variant

The benchmark harness needs shell-driven profiling access. The shipped app does not need to expose that surface globally.

The project therefore split those concerns cleanly:

- the dedicated `benchmark` target manifest carries `android:profileable="shell=true"`
- the shipped app manifest does not

That keeps the profiling workflow available for repeatable local performance work without widening the production manifest more than necessary.

### Why The DataTransport Jobs Are Accepted For Now

The device audit found short `com.google.android.datatransport.runtime` jobs even while NeoAlarm was otherwise idle.

The important engineering question was whether that work belonged to the app or to a dependency.

The Gradle dependency audit answered that clearly:

- the jobs come from the ML Kit barcode-scanning stack used by the QR mission
- they are not being scheduled by the alarm engine
- they are not evidence of accidental polling or leftover foreground-service behavior

That does not make them irrelevant. A local-first alarm app should still be suspicious of dependency-level background work.

But the correct decision for the current product stage is to track and document that cost, not to panic-refactor around it immediately. The QR mission is a core feature, and the observed jobs are small compared with the user value of the current scanner pipeline.

The future escape hatches are already clear:

- replace the QR stack with a lighter decoder
- move QR into a separate flavor or optional module
- keep the core alarm package free of ML Kit in a reduced build

Those are real product/architecture tradeoffs. For now, the project chooses capability plus visibility over premature surgery.

## Storage Audit Snapshot: March 11, 2026

An on-device storage audit on March 11, 2026 was triggered by a simple but important question: why does a build with only one configured alarm appear to consume roughly 300 MB of internal storage?

The answer is that almost all of that footprint comes from debug-install runtime payload, not from alarm data.

### What The Audit Found

The installed package on device was a debuggable build with these key numbers:

- installed `base.apk`: `214,677,988` bytes
- app-private data directory total: about `73 MB`
- `shared_prefs`: about `20 KB`
- `files`: about `7.5 KB`
- `databases`: about `56 KB`
- `code_cache`: about `297 KB`
- `app_flutter`: about `73 MB`

The important finding inside `app_flutter` was that the debug runtime had copied Flutter assets into app-private storage:

- `app_flutter/flutter_assets/kernel_blob.bin`: about `64.9 MB`
- `app_flutter/flutter_assets/isolate_snapshot_data`: about `11.0 MB`
- `app_flutter/flutter_assets/vm_snapshot_data`: about `15 KB`

That means the large number the user sees is dominated by two debug-era buckets:

- the installed debug APK itself
- duplicated Flutter debug assets in app-private storage

The persisted alarm data is tiny by comparison. One configured alarm does not explain the reported footprint.

### Why This Matters

This audit established an important engineering rule for the project:

- debug-install size is not a meaningful proxy for shipped-app size

For NeoAlarm, debug builds are especially misleading because they carry:

- the Flutter debug kernel blob
- large engine/runtime payloads
- native barcode-scanning libraries and models
- additional debug-mode asset duplication into `app_flutter`

That makes the storage number useful for local developer awareness, but poor as a product-facing size metric.

### What This Means For Future Size Checks

If contributors want to reason about real user footprint, they should inspect release artifacts and release installs.

The local build comparison during the audit made that clear:

- debug APK: roughly `214.7 MB`
- release APK: roughly `67.8 MB`

The project should therefore treat release builds as the source of truth for storage and distribution discussions, while treating debug builds as a development convenience with intentionally inflated size characteristics.

### Follow-Up Device Check

A follow-up `adb` pass against the installed release build added one more important detail.

The release package itself was confirmed on-device at roughly `68.3 MB`, which matches the local release artifact much more closely than the earlier debug package.

But the app's credential-encrypted data directory inode remained unchanged across the debug-to-release upgrade. That means the release install preserved the existing app-private data from the previous debug install rather than starting from a clean slate.

This matters because the earlier debug audit had already shown roughly `73 MB` of duplicated Flutter debug assets inside app-private storage. Installing release over debug does not automatically remove those artifacts. So a release-over-debug storage reading can still look artificially large even when the release APK itself is much smaller.

The `adb` follow-up also confirmed a normal non-debuggable release package shape:

- package flags no longer include `DEBUGGABLE`
- `primaryCpuAbi=arm64-v8a`
- installed package directory under `/data/app` is about `65 MB`
- Android created an `oat/arm64/base.odex` path for compiled release code

Because the release app is no longer debuggable, `run-as` cannot inspect the app-private data directory directly. That means package-code size is easy to verify on-device for release builds, while app-private data breakdown requires either:

- a clean measurement before switching away from a debuggable build
- a rooted device
- or a fresh release install followed by Android Settings storage inspection

The engineering rule becomes stricter:

- release size checks should use a fresh release install or a cleared app data directory, not merely a release APK installed over an existing debug build

## Device Performance Audit Snapshot: March 11, 2026

After the storage audit, the next question was whether the installed release package was behaving efficiently on a real phone rather than only in source review.

An `adb`-driven device audit on March 11, 2026 focused on:

- cold and warm launch timing
- release-package footprint on device
- steady-state process memory
- obvious background work while the app was idle
- a basic shell interaction sweep on the live dashboard

### Launch Timing

Using `am start -W` against the installed release build, the observed cold-start times on device were:

- `229 ms`
- `220 ms`
- `212 ms`

Warm and hot launches were much shorter and sometimes reported by ActivityManager as `HOT` or `UNKNOWN`, which is normal for re-entry cases where Android is resuming an already created task rather than rebuilding the activity from scratch.

The practical takeaway is that launch performance is already strong enough that startup is not the main performance risk for this app.

### Memory Shape

`dumpsys meminfo` against the active release process showed a total process footprint in this range:

- `TOTAL PSS`: about `168 MB`
- `TOTAL RSS`: about `252 MB`

The important buckets were:

- `Graphics`: about `61 MB`
- `Code`: about `52 MB`
- `Native Heap`: about `23.5 MB`
- `Java Heap`: about `4.8 MB`

This is a reasonable shape for a Flutter release build with a full-screen SurfaceView and camera/barcode dependencies, but it also confirms that graphics and code dominate the runtime footprint more than app-managed data structures do.

### CPU At Idle

After a short settle window on the dashboard, repeated `top` samples showed:

- `0.0%` CPU for the NeoAlarm process at idle

That is the right result. It means the app is not obviously spinning in the foreground once it has settled.

### Background Work

The battery and alarm inspection did reveal one recurring non-alarm background behavior:

- short `JobInfoSchedulerService` executions from `com.google.android.datatransport.runtime`

These jobs were brief and not large enough to dominate CPU usage, but they do exist. They appear to come from dependency-level infrastructure rather than from the alarm engine itself.

This does not currently look like a serious efficiency failure, but it is worth keeping visible because a local-first alarm app should stay suspicious of any background work it did not explicitly design for.

### Alarm And Service Behavior At Idle

Two positive checks came out of the device audit:

- there was no lingering foreground service while the app was simply sitting on the dashboard
- `dumpsys alarm` showed the expected exact-alarm scheduling owned by `AlarmReceiver`, rather than a noisy spread of unnecessary background timers

That supports the intended architecture: idle app shell, native scheduling only when needed.

### Rendering Signal Limitations

`dumpsys gfxinfo` was much less useful than the other signals during the dashboard interaction sweep.

Because the app renders through Flutter's surface pipeline, the system-level `gfxinfo` summary produced only a tiny frame sample for the exercised path. That is enough to confirm the command worked, but not enough to treat it as a reliable rendering benchmark.

The engineering implication is clear:

- basic `adb` rendering commands are useful sanity checks
- real frame-performance benchmarking for this app should use Macrobenchmark and Perfetto if rendering becomes a concern

### What This Audit Means

The release build does not look slow in the obvious ways.

The strongest device-level conclusions from this audit are:

- startup time is already good
- idle CPU is effectively zero
- memory is substantial but understandable for a Flutter + camera + ML package
- the alarm engine is not leaving foreground-service work behind on the dashboard
- dependency-level background jobs exist and should be watched, but they are currently small

So the next performance work for NeoAlarm should focus less on raw startup speed and more on:

- keeping graphics/memory growth under control as UI complexity increases
- watching dependency-driven background work
- using better tooling for rendering benchmarks than `gfxinfo` alone

### Follow-Up Tooling Result

The follow-up implementation turned that recommendation into working project infrastructure.

On March 11, 2026, the connected Samsung `SM-G990U1` completed the new Macrobenchmark cold-start run successfully. The current baseline recorded by the benchmark harness was:

- `timeToInitialDisplayMs`: min `517.3`, median `581.8`, max `646.5`
- `timeToFullDisplayMs`: min `517.3`, median `581.8`, max `646.5`

The benchmark emitted ten iteration-level Perfetto traces plus structured JSON benchmark data inside the repository build output, and the manual Perfetto script produced a standalone startup trace in the ignored artifacts directory.

That changes the engineering story in an important way: NeoAlarm no longer relies only on source review and improvised shell checks for performance work. It has a repeatable measurement path that contributors can rerun and compare over time.

## Security Audit Snapshot: March 11, 2026

A source audit of the Android and Flutter codebase on March 11, 2026 found four issues worth recording before wider distribution.

### 1. Full-Screen Alarm UI Must Not Trust A Forgeable Activity Action

The launcher activity is exported because it has to be launchable by the system and the user.

That is fine.

What is not fine is letting an external caller supply an action string that is treated as sufficient proof that the activity should behave like an active alarm surface.

The current implementation allows the window to enter alarm-style lock-screen/full-screen mode when the activity sees the internal alarm action, even if that action was supplied from outside the app.

That is the wrong trust boundary.

The correct boundary is the persisted active ring session. A full-screen alarm experience should become active because the native alarm engine says there is an active alarm, not because an incoming intent claims there is one.

### 2. Local-Only Storage Must Not Leak Into Backup By Accident

The product promise is local-first and on-device.

Right now, alarm definitions and active mission/session data are stored in app-private preferences, which is acceptable for MVP persistence. But if backup is left enabled by default, that data may still flow into Android backup and device-transfer paths.

That is not a cryptographic break, but it is a real policy mismatch:

- alarm schedules are personal behavior data
- QR mission targets are part of dismissal configuration
- active session state is operational alarm data the user may reasonably assume stays only on the handset

If the project says "everything stays on-device," backup behavior has to be an intentional decision rather than a platform default.

### 3. Exported Reschedule Paths Must Be Narrow And Defensive

The boot/time/timezone reschedule receiver exists for legitimate system broadcasts.

That is also fine.

The risk comes from treating an exported receiver as a harmless utility surface. An exported receiver that immediately performs alarm rescheduling is part of the app's privileged behavior. If another app can explicitly target it, the receiver should still behave defensively:

- validate that the action is one of the allowed system reschedule triggers
- avoid turning scheduling failures into crash loops
- treat repeated external invocation as hostile noise, not as a normal caller pattern

This matters because alarm reliability work often creates exactly the sort of components that need strict exported-surface discipline.

### 4. Public Releases Need Real Signing Hygiene

The current release build configuration still uses the debug signing config.

That is acceptable for local development and device testing. It is not acceptable for public release engineering.

If contributors or users install public builds, release artifacts need:

- a dedicated release keystore
- controlled signing in CI or release infrastructure
- a clean distinction between local debug convenience and real distributed artifacts

This is less about an in-app exploit and more about treating distribution as part of the security model.

### What This Audit Means For The Project

The main lesson is that an alarm app should be treated as a system-behavior app, not just a utility UI.

Even without a backend and even without internet permission, the app still controls high-impact device behavior. That means the engineering bar has to include:

- exported component review
- storage and backup policy review
- release signing discipline
- regular security audits alongside reliability audits

These findings are recorded here because they affect architecture, not just cleanup. They are part of the engineering story of the project and should stay visible until they are resolved.

The initial mitigation pass adopted four concrete policies:

- lock-screen/full-screen alarm presentation is now authorized by persisted active-session state rather than a forgeable activity action
- Android auto-backup is disabled for MVP so local alarm and mission state does not quietly escape into backup flows
- the exported reschedule receiver now accepts only the expected system actions and treats failures defensively
- release signing moved to a local `key.properties` strategy with CI-secret support and a deliberate debug fallback for non-distribution builds

That signing strategy is no longer only theoretical. The repository now has a locally generated release keystore and can produce a real signed `release` APK, while still keeping the signing material out of Git through ignored local files and optional CI secret materialization.

Those changes matter because they reinforce a broader rule: convenience boundaries are not security boundaries. Internal action strings, platform defaults, and development signing shortcuts are acceptable only when they do not weaken the trust model of the product.

## Why The Release Pipeline Is Part Of The Security Model

It is tempting to treat CI and release automation as separate from application security.

For this project, that would be a mistake.

The release pipeline decides:

- whether static analysis runs continuously
- whether dependency-risk changes are reviewed automatically
- whether release artifacts are reproducible
- whether signing material is handled explicitly or implicitly

That is why the repository now treats CI as part of the engineering boundary:

- build/test automation catches regressions
- CodeQL covers source-level SAST
- dependency review covers dependency-surface changes
- tagged release workflows define how installable APKs are produced and published

This is not bureaucracy. It is how an open-source app avoids shipping a different engineering standard than the one its source code claims to follow.

## Why The Documentation Must Be Strong

This repository will attract contributors who are capable of extending it beyond the original author. That only works if the engineering story is visible.

Strong documentation should answer:

- what is guaranteed
- what is merely preferred
- what constraints forced a design
- where to put new work
- which decisions are already settled

If the answer to those questions lives only in source code, the project will slow down as soon as the first non-trivial feature lands.
