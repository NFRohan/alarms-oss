# Documentation Index

This project treats documentation as part of the engineering surface, not as a cleanup step after implementation.

## Start Here

- Read [documentation-strategy.md](documentation-strategy.md) for the documentation contract.
- Read [planning/overall-plan.md](planning/overall-plan.md) for the full implementation roadmap.
- Read [planning/sprint-plan.md](planning/sprint-plan.md) for the execution sequence.
- Read [testing/test-strategy.md](testing/test-strategy.md) for the quality and CI model.
- Read [testing/performance-workflow.md](testing/performance-workflow.md) for Macrobenchmark, Perfetto, and dependency-audit usage.
- Read [architecture/engineering-story.md](architecture/engineering-story.md) to understand why the system is shaped this way.
- Read [architecture/overview.md](architecture/overview.md) for the high-level technical model.
- Read [architecture/active-session-lifecycle.md](architecture/active-session-lifecycle.md) for the authoritative active alarm state machine.
- Read [contributing/engineering-standards.md](contributing/engineering-standards.md) before making architecture or behavior changes.

## Documentation Layers

- `README.md`: top-level project orientation.
- `docs/documentation-strategy.md`: what documentation must exist and when it must be updated.
- `docs/planning/*.md`: roadmap and sprint-level execution planning.
- `docs/testing/*.md`: quality strategy, CI expectations, and device-testing approach.
- `docs/testing/performance-workflow.md`: performance benchmarking, Perfetto capture, and dependency-audit workflow.
- `docs/architecture/*.md`: stable system-level understanding and engineering narrative.
- `docs/adr/*.md`: irreversible or high-impact decisions with context and tradeoffs.
- `docs/contributing/*.md`: contributor workflow and engineering expectations.

If you change system behavior and cannot identify which document should be updated, update this index first so the gap becomes explicit.
